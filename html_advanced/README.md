# ADVANCED HTML

## DESCRIPTION
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, serves as the backbone for structuring elements on websites. An HTML document is essentially a text file providing instructions to web browsers on how to render and present content. Additionally, XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are application languages, each adhering to standards such as XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language).
